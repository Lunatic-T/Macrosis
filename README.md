# Macroing

* A settings file will be created in the same folder that the Macro resides in

* You will need a Valid Webhook

* A Private Server Link 

* After this, it should save your choices and start macroing automatically!

# Cool Features

* No stupid watermark on embeds

* Does not log Rare Biomes that you join from other servers, making sure that you don't get a warning for accidentally pinging @everyone :)

* Multi-Instance macroing, a third option will come up if you have more than 1 client running, asking you which log file to use for macroing (if more than 1 log file, it will show up)

* Sends only 1 Embed for each biome, it'll edit the "started" embed so it says "ended" if it ended.
